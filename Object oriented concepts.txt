Object oriented concepts

1. Abstraction

- interface

- abstract class

- difference between abstract and interface (remaining)


2. Inheritance

- dimond problem

- method overriding - signature same but implementation different
    1. method with same signature but with different implementation
    2. gets checked at runtime

- method overloading
    1. signature different, implementation same/different
    2.gets checked at compile time.

-super keyword
    - can be used with variable
    - can be used with method
    - can be used with constuctor


3. Polymorphism
    
    - compile time Polymorphism / static 
    
    - run time Polymorphism / dynamic  - e.g. Method Override

    example List interface, ArrayList, LinkedList use this interface



4. Encapsulation
    private
    public
    protected
    default

    data hiding
